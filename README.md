Game Dev Project 4

Verbs: Chase, Splice

Our game is a top-down rolling game in which the player controls a virus. The player's objective is to roll around and corrupt all the other cells before being caught by the white blood cells. By corrupting other cells you create more virus cells and buy yourself time in addition to getting closer to your win condition.
